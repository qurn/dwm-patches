# dwm-patches
My patches for dwm

4statusevents
- Splits CltStatusText into 4. So you can have different actions for clicks on different locations in the statusbar.

fulltile
- Running applications in fullscreen will fill the tile instead of the screen. To get fill the entire screen just maximize the window and hide the bar.

noNET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK
- Dissables NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK again. Fullscreen videos in Firefox will fill the tile, not the screen.

multiAaCmNbPt4sNn
- Combines attachaside, centeredmaster, noborder, pertag, 4statusevents and noNET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK
